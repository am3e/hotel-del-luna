Hotel Del Luna!

Towards the end of January 2022, I started watching Hotel Del Luna, a korean drama television series on Netflix. The show is about a hotel owner who has serviced this hotel for souls (ghosts) for a milennia as punishment for her actions and in 2019 (when the story takes place) requires a new human manager to take care of the hotel's affairs (taxes, operation tasks). The hotel does not have a website since it is a hotel for ghosts, so I thought it would be fun to create one.

I am a self taught developer with one year experience writing node scripts, working on the command line reporting to the COO for all things sales operations and customer success. I was let go in November 2021 and so I've thrown myself into front-end development to put my skills into action.

The following are notes of things I want to add to the website.

features to create:
    - permission to use camera (see if there is a library so you can tell if there is a human or not)
    two different versions (ghost vs human)
        - reseveration modal (regular form vs death form)
            add for more than one guest?
        - theme change
        - different info available (ex ghosts: support, terms // humans: pricing)
    after ghost registation
        - online portal to check out hotel

    after human registration
        - show payment total and filter to payment > payment goes to another page to buy me a coffee :D


Use the code:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
