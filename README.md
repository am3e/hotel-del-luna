Project Name: Hotel Del Luna!

Towards the end of January 2022, I started watching Hotel Del Luna, a korean drama television series on Netflix. The show is about a hotel owner who has serviced this hotel for souls (ghosts) for a milennia as punishment for her actions and in 2019 (when the story takes place) requires a new human manager to take care of the hotel's affairs (taxes, operation tasks). The hotel does not have a website since it is a hotel for ghosts, so I thought it would be fun to create one.

I am a self taught developer with one year experience writing node scripts, working on the command line reporting to the COO for all things sales operations and customer success. I was let go in November 2021 and so I've thrown myself into front-end development to put my skills into action.

If you have any recommendations for my project, please let me know!

features to create:
1.  Reservation Modal
2.  Ghost Mode and Human Mode (different sites, similar to Dark theme and Light theme but in the context of the tv show)
3.  CSS carousel for Amentities page
4.  Booking process (check availability/room list with pricing/complete personal details and confirmation
5.  Website functionality
6.  Visually nice

Fun things to look into after functional features are created:
//permission to use camera (see if there is a library so you can tell if there is someone in camera or not)
//payment page flips to personal portfolio?
//pricing page, conversion rates - API?
//online portal to check out hotel - like a 2D canvas game 


Use the code:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
