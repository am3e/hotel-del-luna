            <p>Experience great comfort and leave this world without regrets!
            Here, at Hotel Del Luna, you can do all the things you failed to fulfill while you were alive that you wish to complete before you go to the afterlife. No matter how broken or ripped or destroyed by this world you have become, we will revive you to the self you feel best in and provide healing. Whether you’ve lost your way or continue to hold on, we will provide you what you need to move on.</p>

            <p>
            The rules of Hotel Del Luna cannot be explained by human logic. Maps and watches cannot work in a place beyond time and space. Everything in it doesn’t exist in the real world, so the skies the limit!</p>
